        <h1>About Us ... </h1>
        <p>
            <B>VIBGYOR </B>is an institution which was envisaged to provide young students with a healthy environment to nurture themselves cognitively, intellectually, artistically and athletically; along with also imbibing our moral and cultural values, which will enable them to become responsible global citizens of tomorrow.<br><br>Our core teaching methodologies focus on a colourful blend of traditional classroom learning combined with extensive sports facilities, wide range of extra-curricular activities, numerous social and cultural events and similar special occasions, which ensure a holistic approach to our students’ overall growth and progress.Our caring teachers devote themselves to our students and their needs every day; while also being their guardian, mentor and friend.<br><br>
            At VIBGYOR, our curriculum is designed with the objective to constructively ignite our young students’ minds and positively navigate their vibrant energy towards building a better and brighter future for India and the World.We also firmly believe in creating an atmosphere for collaborative learning; wherein our students grow with experiences from the outside world - their surroundings, their families, their peers and through their deep bonds of friendship.
            <br><br>The three strong ‘pillars’ below define us for who we are:<br>
            => Enthuse: With our well-researched curriculum, modern teaching methodologies and wide range of extra-curricular activities and facilities, we, at VIBGYOR constantly strive to enthuse our students with fascinating learning experiences every single day.
            We work tirelessly towards creating future leaders, thinkers, change makers and givers, who would make a real difference in tomorrow’s world while also upholding our cultural traditions.<br><br>
            => Enlighten: At VIBGYOR, we aspire to provide our students with holistic education across the learning spectrum. We guide our students to nurture their own interests and then channelise their fresh energy towards harnessing their special talents and abilities; whether academic or otherwise. As a result of this organic process, our students also get an insight into their own strengths and weaknesses, their likes and dislikes, their passion and motivation.
            As the old saying goes, “Knowing others is wisdom, knowing thyself is enlightenment.”<br><br>
            => Empower: Empowering students for a better tomorrow is at the heart of the VIBGYOR world.<br><br></ul>
            It is our belief, our mantra and our inspiration.
